# About.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game with basic knowledge of Python! Would be glad if you could give me some tips on how to improve my code!
I added to the repo both files so you can run it on Jupyter Notebook or any other compiler of your choice!

Also, feel free to use this as a base code to create your own code!
